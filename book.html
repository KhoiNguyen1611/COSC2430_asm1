                <p id="desc">Learn about the easy and proven way to build good habits and break the bad ones. Whatâ€™s a habit? If someone were to ask you about your daily habits, you might need some time to think about them. Thatâ€™s because a habit, by definition, is an act that you perform automatically by instinct. Like when you walk into a dark room, you instinctively turn on a light switch, right? Habits are actions you donâ€™t even have to think about, which is why you might not realize how a small daily action can have a powerful effect on your life. If youâ€™re saving a dollar a day or smoking a cigarette a day, these actions may not seem like much now, but twenty years from now, those habits can either make you rich or, unfortunately, kill you. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to understand how habits are formed, so you can learn how to kick the bad habits, implement the healthy ones, and take back control of your life.</p>
